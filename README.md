# My First JavaScript Project(To-Do List)

## Overview
This project is my first attempt at creating a to-do list using JavaScript. I've implemented several features to make it functional and user-friendly.

## Features
1. **Progress Bar for Completed Tasks**: Users can track their progress visually with a dynamic progress bar that shows the percentage of completed tasks.
2. **Filter Items by First Letter**: I've added a feature that allows users to filter tasks based on the selected first letter. This makes it easier to find specific items.
3. **Edit and Update Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks and update their details. This ensures flexibility and better task management.
4. **Ability to Specify Completed Tasks**: Mark Completed Tasks with a Check Mark: Users can indicate completed tasks by marking them with a check mark. This visual cue helps distinguish completed items from those still pending.
5. **Validation for Adding Repetitious Items**: I've included validation to prevent users from adding duplicate tasks. This helps maintain a clean and organized list.
6. **Empty Input Handling**: Users receive feedback if they try to add an empty task. The system prompts them to enter valid content.
7. **Confirmation for Clearing All Items**: To prevent accidental data loss, I've added a confirmation prompt when users attempt to clear all tasks.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to this project! ðŸ˜Š
